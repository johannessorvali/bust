This pathetic project is a simulation of a drug enforcement unit's application
where cops can add to a database the drug arrests they have made.

Each arrest has a date, a cop name, a criminal name, a drug name and the amount of the drug confiscated.

The date and drug name variables are selected from predefined menus.

When an arrest is added to database, the amount of drug confiscated is also added to the overall amount of
this drug in the storage. 

There are two pages: arrest.html where the arrests are made and storage.html which shows the amounts of drugs 
in the storage.
